      <description>The choice of touring bicycle can really make or break your bike tour. If you have one that is a pain to work on and move around, or have one that just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work very well the tour becomes a trial of your mechanic skills.
On the other hand, if you have a bike that works great and is reliable you are setup for success on your tour.
For that reason and many more we will detail below we bought a Bike Friday Tandem Twosday to tour on.</description>

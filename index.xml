      <description>The gear you bring with you on a trip of around the world by bike is essential. There is simply no other way to put it.
You are dependent on your gear, especially the bike, to hold up against the strain of loaded touring going up and down mountains, across terrible road surfaces, through many a pothole among many other issues.
The hope is that it all holds up without issue, but that is never going to happen as we quickly found out as we started our tour in Thailand.</description>

      <description>Below you will find a map and table of all of our rides so far on our 2019 tour from Bangkok, Thailand to Barcelona, Spain. Check back often to follow along.
You can also follow along the rides on Strava, which also happens to be where this map is being built from.

      <title>Our Bike Friday Touring Tandem</title>

      <description>The choice of touring bicycle can really make or break your bike tour. If you have one that is a pain to work on and move around, or have one that just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work very well the tour becomes a trial of your mechanic skills.
On the other hand, if you have a bike that works great and is reliable you are setup for success on your tour.
For that reason and many more we will detail below we bought a Bike Friday Tandem Twosday to tour on.</description>

      <description>2019 is the year of the bike tour for us. Justin has semi-retired from work to allow us to travel the world for a year or 2, or really however long we want to tour the world.
The plan for this first year is to follow in the footsteps of many of the wonderful Warmshowers guests that we have had stay with us in Zhuhai, China over the past 4 years.</description>

      <description>2019 is the year of the bike tour for us. Justin has semi-retired from work to allow us to travel the world for a year or 2, or really however long we want to tour the world.
The plan for this first year is to follow in the footsteps of many of the wonderful Warmshowers guests that we have had stay with us in Zhuhai, China over the past 4 years.</description>

      <description>I have been sick for the past 5 days with the flu and it has really kicked my ass. But it finally feels like I am on the mend and am on my way to being better again. All said and done it was not the worst thing I have ever been through.</description>
